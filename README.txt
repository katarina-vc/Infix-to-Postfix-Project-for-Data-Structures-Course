Project 2 for Data Structures COP3530
by Katarina Capalbo n01399315

*****Description:*****
This project converts infix expressions to postfix expressions using a Stack ADT. The stack uses an int array as its
underlying data structure. The user enters in an infix expression without any spaces, and then the program 
outputs the postfix equivalent of that expression.


***** BEFORE COMPILING ******
Use an IDE (I am using Eclipse) to run the source code.  

Before compiling: 
Create a Java project and copy the Stack.java and Project2.java files to your
src Project file. You should then be able to run the program.


****** EXPECTED OUTPUT *******
3 columns will appear, the first column is the char in your infix expression string being evaluated, 
the second column is the current postfix expression string, and the third column are the contents
of the stack.
