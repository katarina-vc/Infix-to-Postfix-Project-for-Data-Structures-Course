*****Description:*****
This project converts infix expressions to postfix expressions using a Stack Abstract Data Type. The stack uses an integer array as its
underlying data structure. The user enters in an infix expression without any spaces, and then the program 
outputs the postfix equivalent of that expression.

Infix notation is the notation commonly used in arithmetical and logical formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of operators between operands—"infixed operators"—such as the plus sign in 2 + 2.

Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands appear before their operators. For example 2 2 +


****** EXPECTED OUTPUT *******
3 columns will appear, the first column is the char in your infix expression string being evaluated, 
the second column is the current postfix expression string, and the third column are the contents
of the stack. Please see the "Expected Output" folder for screenshots of the expected output when running this program.
